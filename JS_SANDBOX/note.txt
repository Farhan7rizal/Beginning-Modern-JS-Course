Data type in JS
Primitive Data Types:
    Stored directly in the location the varibale accesses stored on the stack
    1. String
    2. Number
    3. Boolean
    4. Null
    5. Undefined
    6. Symbols (ES6)

Reference Data Types:
    Accessed by reference Objects that are stored on the 'HEAP' A pointer to a location in memory
    1. Arrays
    2. Object Literals
    3. Funtions
    4. Dates
    5. Anything else

JS is Dynamically typed languages
    > Types are associated with values not varibale
    > The same variable can hold miltiples types
    > We do not need to specify types
    > Most other languages are statically typed (Java, C#, C++)
    > There are supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing (TypeScript, Flow.js)
